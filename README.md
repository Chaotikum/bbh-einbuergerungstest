BBH Einbürgerungstest
=====================

This is an alternative citizenship test, built together with students from the
[GGS St. Jürgen][ggs] school and the [Buddenbrookhaus][bbh] museum in Lübeck,
Germany, for the exhibition ["Fremde Heimat"][fh].

It's a fairly simple jQuery application.

Kiosk mode on Windows 10 Home
--------------------------

Since Microsoft only offers a real kiosk mode on Windows >= Professional we had
to go a little different way. Killing explorer.exe to disable buttons and
gestures and using Chrome's kiosk mode does the job quite well. Our autostart
file is `start.bat`.
